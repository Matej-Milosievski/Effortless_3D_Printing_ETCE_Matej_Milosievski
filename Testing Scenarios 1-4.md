# Test Scenario 1

This scenario includes a breakage characterized by ***12 distinct surfaces, 11 located on one side end of the component and 1 curved surface on the opposite side alongside one axis***. 

**Our aim with this first initial scenario was to test whether the Automated modeling tool could link a curved surface along with multiple flat surfaces.**

                        CAD model generated through Automated modeling; Alternative 6 – Test Scenario 1

From the 6 generated alternatives, alternatives 1-3 have a smooth connection, whereas 4-6 have a sharp connection. Upon closer inspection, we can conclude that the smooth connection does not offer an “air-tight” fit between the two parts. On the contrary, the sharp connection produces a perfect, “air-tight” fit between the two objects.

        Comparison of part fit between a smooth and sharp connection; Alternative 2 vs Alternative 5 – Test Scenario 1

### For the purpose of maintaining a consistent and objective comparison between all alternatives, all generated alternatives were generated with a maximum selected volume (thickness) by dragging the respective slider to the utmost right. Due to structural integrity, the part with the most volume and a sharp connection was chosen as most suitable, making alternative 5 the most suitable solution for a fix for the broken part. This alternative (second to last one) will become a trend in the upcoming scenarios, in others words serving as the “most intelligent” AI generated solution for repairs of this kind.

# Test Scenario 2
This scenario includes a breakage characterized by ***36 distinct surfaces, 32 located on one end-piece of the component and 4 on the opposite one, with a spherical opening and an elliptical intrusion alongside one axis (higher complexity as compared to test scenario 1)***.

**Our aim with this second scenario was to test whether the Automated modeling tool could generate a linking part with higher geometric complexity requirement in order to result in a perfect fit.**

        Comparison of part fit between a smooth and sharp connection; Alternative 1 vs Alternative 4 – Test Scenario 2

Similarly to Test Scenario 1, the second to last alternative (4) once again resembles the most suitable automatically generated solution for the broken piece, due to its “air-tight” fit, as well as the largest overall volume, hence higher structural integrity if 3D printed. Even though upon first sight there are some evident inorganic shaped protrusions which seem too protrude out the automatically generated alternative, they are actually a part of that same alternative. In other words, as portrayed in the images above, the actual sections which connect the auto-generated piece to the broken-off end section are in fact flat surfaces – resulting from the fact that these alternatives provide sharp connections.

# Test Scenario 3

This scenario includes a breakage characterized by ***18 distinct surfaces, 6 located on one side of the component and 12 on the opposite side. Unlike the two previous scenarios, the Automated modeling tool would have to generate a solution with a curvature, or rather, a mesh that protrudes within two axes’.*** 

**Our aim with this third scenario was to test whether the Automated modeling tool could generate a linking part with between two parts positioned on a different central axis on the same plane.**

        Comparison of part fit between a smooth and sharp connection; Alternative 2 vs Alternative 5 – Test Scenario 3

Once again, the second to last scenario proves to be the best automatically generated solution due to the sharp connection and relatively most optimal shape and direction of the generated mesh. This being said, there is an obvious flaw with this automatically generated solution (alternative 5 and all other alternatives) due to the fact that it does not connect the two models with same radius as the original (unbroken) piece, but rather connects the two pieces via the shortest distance. In many applications, this may result in an inaccurate fit in terms of the use of the reconstructed part. For this purpose, it is necessary to do some additional testing, hence Test Scenario 4.

# Test Scenario 4

This scenario includes a breakage characterized by the exact same surface parameters as Test Scenario 4. However, this time around, ***a cylinder with the exact location and size of radius as the inner curve has been added. This will cylinder will be selected as a *Body to avoid* within the tab of the Automated modeling feature, with the idea of recreating the original curvature through excluding this cylinder.***

**Our aim with this fourth and final scenario is to the test whether the flaw in Test Scenario 3 can be mitigated using additional geometry to be excluded, and whether or not the newly generated alternatives will “learn” to follow the curvature of the excluded geometry whilst generating the component.**

        Comparison of part fit between a smooth and sharp connection; Alternative 1 vs Alternative 5 – Test Scenario 4

Repeatedly, the second to last automatically generated model once again is arguably the most suitable out of all alternatives. Even so, it leaves a lot to be desired in when it compares to how an experienced CAD user might model a design solution for connecting these two components based on look, functionality and intended use case. Even though the goal of this test scenario was partially achieved due to the fact that the automatically generated solutions did in fact avoid the cylinder, thus resulting in an inner curvature being formed, the automatically generated solutions tended to still generate around that cylinder in areas which were not necessarily desired. A solution to this inconvenience would be running another Test Scenario with a cube where one end has the desired curvature.  A test alternative which is worth noting is Alternative 6 as it’s the first of its kind encountered during the testing with respect to its geometry. It also important towards understanding the “thought process” behind the automated modeling. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46dc2cd9-c57c-4667-8068-0ae9e06499c5" alt="CAD model generated through Automated modeling; Alternative 6 – Test Scenario 4" width="1080"/>
</p>

Alternative 6 is characterized by a hollow area between the area of the two components where the intended fitting should be theoretically generated. Instead, there is an organic body above where the cylinder was placed which essentially connects two plates. Theoretically, all of the required inputs which have been entered have been satisfied, however, due to obvious reasoning, this design alternative would not be a suitable design solution for the intended use case. This alternative embodies the thought process of the Automated modeling tool, since it strives to connect two or more objects with the least possible material via the shortest pathway, unless specified otherwise by the user. This may very well be due to the fact that the intended use case for this tool is not reconstruction of broken plastic parts, but rather, coming up with complicated design solution for assemblies within the automotive industry and other industries (where the majority of assemblies are not made of plastic/ 3D printed)
