# Test Scenario 1

This scenario includes a breakage characterized by 12 distinct surfaces, 11 located on one side end of the component and 1 curved surface on the opposite side alongside one axis. 

**Our aim with this first initial scenario was to test whether the Automated modeling tool could link a curved surface along with multiple flat surfaces.**

                        CAD model generated through Automated modeling; Alternative 6 – Test Scenario 1

From the 6 generated alternatives, alternatives 1-3 have a smooth connection, whereas 4-6 have a sharp connection. Upon closer inspection, we can conclude that the smooth connection does not offer an “air-tight” fit between the two parts. On the contrary, the sharp connection produces a perfect, “air-tight” fit between the two objects.

        Comparison of part fit between a smooth and sharp connection; Alternative 2 vs Alternative 5 – Test Scenario 1

### For the purpose of maintaining a consistent and objective comparison between all alternatives, all generated alternatives were generated with a maximum selected volume (thickness) by dragging the respective slider to the utmost right. Due to structural integrity, the part with the most volume and a sharp connection was chosen as most suitable, making alternative 5 the most suitable solution for a fix for the broken part. This alternative (second to last one) will become a trend in the upcoming scenarios, in others words serving as the “most intelligent” AI generated solution for repairs of this kind.
