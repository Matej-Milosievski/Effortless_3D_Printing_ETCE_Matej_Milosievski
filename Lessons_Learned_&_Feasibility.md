# Lessons Learned & Feasibility Assessment of Fusion 360’s Automated Modeling in Everyday Life Repair Spare Parts

**Using the Automated modeling tool is very much a feasible solution for connecting two broken components which have a breakage (missing section) along the same axis, or need to be linked at an angle less than 45⁰. The second to last alternative with a sharp connection alongside maximum volume will be the most suitable alternative for the larger majority of all scenarios. The benefit of using this tool as compared to remodeling the part using a conventional method (measuring it with calipers and designing it from scratch) would be that it is much easier to generate a CAD model for only the broken-off (missing) section, which certainly is more environmentally friendly and affordable in terms of used filament during the 3D printing stage.**
