# Lessons Learned & Feasibility Assessment of Fusion 360’s Automated Modeling in Everyday Life Repair Spare Parts

**Using the Automated modeling tool is very much a feasible solution for connecting two broken components which have a breakage (missing section) along the same axis, or need to be linked at an angle less than 45⁰. The second to last alternative with a sharp connection alongside maximum volume will be the most suitable alternative for the larger majority of all scenarios. The benefit of using this tool as compared to remodeling the part using a conventional method (measuring it with calipers and designing it from scratch) would be that it is much easier to generate a CAD model for only the broken-off (missing) section, which certainly is more environmentally friendly and affordable in terms of used filament during the 3D printing stage.**

### Subsequent sections of this research will look into how the automated modeling tool behaves if the same component is imported as a scanned model instead of being modeled conventionally. Key learning outcomes would be the maximum number of surfaces which can be connected using this tool   . A side by side comparison will be made of both methods stating the good, the not so good and what could be improved through refinement of this process/ modifications and adjustments of any kind.
